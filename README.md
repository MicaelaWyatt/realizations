# Realizations

Realizations is a personal development app designed to help users become more mindful not only of themselves but who they want to be.

Each user will have a portfolio where they can record check-ins about where they are in life and a user can record a self gratitude card highlighting something they like about themselves (this can be a personality trait, an act of service, or even how they handled a situation)

users can go to their goals page to track short term and long term plans they have for their life
